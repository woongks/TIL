## why learn command line?

mastering the command line gives more power to do something with the machine.

There are many things that can be done only from the command line.

### unix?

OS developed in the mid 1960s. Unix was easily portable to other hardwares (where it was a norm for an OS to be tied to specific hardware).

Today, the name "UNIX" is a trademark of a global consortium called The Open Group.
For an OS to be a true UNIX and have a UNIX trademark, it must pass the conformance tests (not free) from The Open Group.

unix-like are unix that does not have a UNIX trademark.

### kernel?

kernel is a computer program that forms the core of an operating system and manages critical tasks:

- memory management
- task scheduling
- and managing hardware.

linux itself is not an OS, but a kernel. Today, we call the whole OS as Linux. (Some suggest that it should be called as GNU/Linux).

### shell?

shell is a computer interface to an operating system. (zsh, powershell, bash)

### terminal
