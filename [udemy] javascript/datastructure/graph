### adjacency list vs adjacency matrix

#### adjacency list

- can take up less space(in sparse graphs)
- faster to iterate over all edges
- can be slower to lookup specific edge

#### adjacency matrix

- takes up more space(in sparse graphs)
- slower to iterate over all edges
- faster to lookup specific edge
